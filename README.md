# InverseMV: Composing Piano Scores with a Convolutional Video-Music Transformer

This repository contains the code and examples for our paper [InverseMV: Composing Piano Scores with a Convolutional Video-Music Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15320).
Video-Music Transformer (VMT) is an attention-based multi-modal model, which generates piano music for a given video.

## Our Dataset

We release a new dataset composed of over 7 hours of piano scores with
fine alignment between pop music videos and MIDI files.
Our complete InverseMV dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_YCYaj5kAf7oM42BmzYEg2Csu5tPiHR?usp=share_link).

## Demo

Here is an example video fragments from our dataset.
Note that we do not do any post-production.
Each file is made from the original video with a WAVE file converted from the MIDI of the model output.

### Original
The original music of the videos.
